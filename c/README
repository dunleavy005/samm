Main procedures in C++
----------------------------------
* In the E-step, we kick off parallel gibbs samplers. The gibbs samplers will be implemented in C++.
* Gibbs sampler
   - Initialize with data: observed start and end sequence, an initial order, theta
   - Also specify the feature generator
   - Return back: samples of the mutation order, so a list of integers
